# Tetris
![alt text](https://github.com/manderc3/tetris/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Why?
Wrote tetris for fun, it is incomplete but my interest in its development has started to wane. I may return to its development, but I may also not.

Some of this code will be used and improved upon for future game projects.

## Dependencies
- SDL2
- A fancy compiler that supports C++17

## Things that need doing that I cannot be bothered to do
- An end-game state
- Score
- Rendering score and level
- Fixing the speeds per level
- Ability to pause
- Menu and pause screens
- Music
